  ## User Story
  AS A dog-owner, I WANT to find someone or a family who loves dogs as much as me and is willing to take care of my dogs as needed while making money, SO THAT I can focus on my trip with less worries about my dogs. I WANT to see the available hosts who meet my criteria such as budget, care types, number of pets willing to host in my specified city without having to sign up for an account; I WANT to see the host contact and book it directly on the application.
